%%% BEGIN INSTRUCTIONS %%%
This checklist should be at the front of every paper you submit for Sandeep's review. 
For each question, change the default \answerTODO{} to \answerYes{},
\answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}. It is OK if preliminary drafts have a few no's, but mark that carefully so its clear you will add that in.
