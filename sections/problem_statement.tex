Problem Statement

\subsection{Variables and Equations}

The following guidelines govern notation.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Time: } Use a subscript for \textit{discrete} time, such as $x_t$. A timeseries of variable $x$ from time $t_0$ to $t_f$ should be given by $x_{t_0:t_f}$.
    \item \textbf{Use Standard Notation: } In control, the state is generally given by $x_t$, control by $u_t$, policy by $\pi$, and cost function by $J$. Strictly follow the same notation as prior papers by Sandeep or key influential textbooks.
    \item \textbf{Intuitive Variable Choices: } Your reader has a limited attention span, and will forget random notation like $\psi, \Gamma$ unless it is necessary. Suppose we have $K$ epochs to run an algorithm. Instead of $K$, write $N_{\mathrm{epoch}}$, which is obvious in case I forget what $K$ is.


\end{enumerate}
