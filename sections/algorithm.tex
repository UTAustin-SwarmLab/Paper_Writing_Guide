\subsection{Algorithm}
All algorithm lines should be numbered. Each line of the Algorithm should be described (and referenced) sequentially with intuition on why it matters. Do not simply state \textit{what} you do, but tell us \textit{why}. Here is an example: 

\begin{quote}
    \SC{We now describe the key steps in Algorithm 1 to co-design a task-driven encoder and decoder. First, on line 1, we initialize the parameters $\theta$ randomly. Then, our next step is to $\ldots$.}
\end{quote}
