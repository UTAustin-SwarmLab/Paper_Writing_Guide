\subsection{Section Objective}

\textbf{Paragraph 1: Re-cap of novelty and key results}

Highlight the key technical insight, contributions, and key numbers that describe why your method works so well compared to benchmarks. This should be similar to the contributions, but stress intuition and key novelty/insights. 

\textbf{Paragraph 2: Future Work}

Describe next steps, open research questions, and why this line of work is important for the research community. Remind readers if the code or dataset is open-source and link to the URL. If you have read this far and are Sandeep's student, send him an email describing something you have learned from this document and only then start outlining your paper.
