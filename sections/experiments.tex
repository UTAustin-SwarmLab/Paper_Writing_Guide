\subsection{Figure and Caption Guidelines}

All figures should be described and referenced in order in the text. 
Each caption should be descriptive and have a short title in \textbf{bold} describing the key take-away. The caption should describe why your method is better than benchmarks etc. Never have short, obvious captions that describe the plot title, such as ``Plot of Accuracy vs. Latency''.

\subsection{Plots}

The plots should be done using a combination of Matplotlib and the Seaborn Packages in python. All raw data to create the plot should be stored and backed up in GIT as a csv. Axes tick marks, legends, and axes labels should be \textit{at least} \textbf{20 point font}.

If your axes titles or legends describe a mathematical quantity, first state the English name and the variable in LaTex. For example, \textbf{Acceleration $a$}.
